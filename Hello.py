The Streamlit app serves as a platform for:

- Batch running Consult prompts to GPT-4 Turbo to assess performance on Clinical Knowledge Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) from MedQA and NBME self-assessments and practice shelf exams.
- Dynamic input handling for customizable inputs and prompts.
- Option to download Outputs and analyze on the shared Google Sheet.
### Project Roadmap

- [ ]  Expand datasets for DDx, A&P, and clinical reference question testing
- [ ]  Implement automated evaluation tools for metrics
- [ ]  Develop real-time visualization of evaluation processes.
- [ ]  Automate result exporting to separately hosted database for easy process logging."""
